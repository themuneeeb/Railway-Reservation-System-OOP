# 🚆 Railway Reservation System (OOP)
### **A Console-Based Railway Booking Application Implemented Using Object-Oriented Programming Concepts**

The **Railway Reservation System** is a fully console-based application built to demonstrate real-world implementation of core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction**.

This project simulates essential railway booking operations including ticket booking, cancellation, train management, and displaying passenger or train details.

## 📝 Project Overview

This system mimics a simplified version of how a real-world railway reservation service operates.  
Using a structured object-oriented approach, it organizes the railway operations into modular classes for better scalability and understanding.

The project demonstrates your understanding of:
- OOP design patterns  
- Modular coding  
- Console-based user interaction  
- Basic data management and validation  
- Inheritance and class relationships

## 🧩 OOP Concepts Used

| OOP Concept | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| **Classes & Objects** | Core structure: Train, Passenger, Ticket, SystemManager |
| **Encapsulation** | Private attributes with getter/setter methods |
| **Inheritance** | Shared properties for users or train-related classes |
| **Polymorphism** | Overloaded/overridden functions (if applied) |
| **Abstraction** | Separation of user operations from internal logic |
